Demonstration script showing how trustcall extractors can return multiple objects.

This script addresses the user's issue where only one Person object was being extracted
instead of multiple objects (Jack and Jill). The key insight is that the trustcall library
DOES support multiple object extraction through the `filter_state` function in 
`trustcall/_base.py` which iterates through all tool calls and appends each validated 
result to the responses list.

The issue in the original code was using `tool_choice='Person'` which can limit the model
to making fewer tool calls. Using `tool_choice='any'` and improving the prompt helps
encourage multiple parallel tool calls.

IMPORTANT: The trustcall library DOES support multiple object extraction through the 
filter_state function in trustcall/_base.py (lines 448-469). This function iterates 
through ALL tool calls in the AI message and appends each validated result to the 
responses list:

    for tc in msg.tool_calls:
        responses.append(sch.model_validate(tc['args']))

The key is getting the LLM to make multiple parallel tool calls in the first place.

üîç ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:

The issue in the original code is NOT with the trustcall library itself, but with 
how the LLM interprets the tool_choice parameter and prompt instructions.

üìå ORIGINAL CONFIGURATION ISSUES:
   ‚Ä¢ tool_choice='Person' constrains the model to use only the Person tool
   ‚Ä¢ Some LLMs interpret this as "use the Person tool once" rather than 
     "use the Person tool multiple times in parallel"
   ‚Ä¢ The model may try to pack multiple people into a single tool call
   ‚Ä¢ This leads to only extracting the first person mentioned

üìå IMPROVED CONFIGURATION BENEFITS:
   ‚Ä¢ tool_choice='any' gives the model more flexibility
   ‚Ä¢ Allows the model to make multiple parallel tool calls more naturally
   ‚Ä¢ Combined with explicit prompting about parallel tool calls
   ‚Ä¢ Results in separate tool calls for each person

üîß TECHNICAL EXPLANATION:

The trustcall library FULLY SUPPORTS multiple object extraction through the 
filter_state function in trustcall/_base.py (lines 448-469):

    for tc in msg.tool_calls:
        # Process each tool call individually
        responses.append(sch.model_validate(tc['args']))

This means:
‚úÖ The library iterates through ALL tool calls in the AI message
‚úÖ Each tool call gets validated and added to the responses list  
‚úÖ The final result contains ALL successfully validated objects

üí° KEY INSIGHT:
The limitation was upstream (LLM behavior) not downstream (library processing).
The trustcall library was ready to handle multiple objects - it just needed 
the LLM to make multiple tool calls!

üéØ SOLUTION SUMMARY:
1. Use tool_choice='any' instead of tool_choice='Person'
2. Make prompts more explicit about requiring parallel tool calls
3. Emphasize "separate tool call for each person" in instructions
4. The trustcall library will automatically process all tool calls correctly
